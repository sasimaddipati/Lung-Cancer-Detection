1. Abstract
The project is focused on the detection and analysis of lung cancer using advanced machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques. Leveraging publicly available datasets (like the Lung Cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle), the primary goal is to design a predictive model that can accurately identify the presence of lung cancer based on patient features and clinical attributes. In addition, statistical analysis and visual explorations have been incorporated to understand trends, identify high-risk factors, and derive actionable insights. This system aims to support early detection and assist healthcare professionals in decision-making.

2. Introduction
Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest forms of cancer worldwide due to its typically late detection. The primary causes include smoking, genetic predispositions, and environmental factors. With the advent of machine learning, predictive modeling can be a crucial tool in identifying high-risk individuals before cancer becomes terminal. This project applies data-driven techniques to classify patients as cancerous or non-cancerous and explores key indicators of lung cancer development.

3. Objectives
  To develop a reliable machine learning model for early-stage lung cancer detection.
  To evaluate various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
  To visualize patterns and correlations between features (e.g., smoking, age, coughing, chest pain).
  To perform data preprocessing techniques such as outlier removal, normalization, and missing value imputation.
  To interpret model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
  To deploy the model using a Flask web application for easy accessibility by healthcare professionals.

4. Dataset Description
  Source: Kaggle, UCI ML Repository
  Number of Instances: ~1000 patients
  Number of Features: 15â€“20 clinical attributes such as:
  Age
  Gender
  Smoking history
  Chronic diseases
  Shortness of breath
  Fatigue
  Coughing of blood
  Swallowing difficulty
  Lung cancer diagnosis (target variable)

5. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Imputed using median/mode strategy.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Used one-hot and label encoding.
Outlier Detection: Box plots and z-score analysis.
Feature Scaling: StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to normalize the data.
Feature Selection:
Correlation Matrix
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
SelectKBest

6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed age distribution and found lung cancer more prevalent in individuals aged 55+.
Compared smoking history with diagnosis rate; smokers had a 3x higher risk.
Visualized correlation heatmaps and pair plots to identify strongly associated variables.
Gender-based cancer prevalence showed slightly higher risk in males.

7. Model Development
Models Evaluated:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Hyperparameter Tuning:
